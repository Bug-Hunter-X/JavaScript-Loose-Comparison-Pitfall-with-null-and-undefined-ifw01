# JavaScript Loose Comparison Pitfall with null and undefined
This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error stemming from the loose comparison operator (==) when dealing with null and undefined values.
The `bug.js` file contains code that showcases this issue. The `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version using strict equality (===).
The loose comparison (==) can lead to unexpected behavior and logical errors because it performs type coercion before comparison which can produce unintended outcomes. 
Always prefer strict equality (===) for reliable comparisons, especially when handling null and undefined values.
